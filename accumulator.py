    #   1. The structural agent's output schema (STRUCTURAL_OUTPUT_SCHEMA
    #      in pipeline_runner_v2.py) does not include a top-level
    #      `window` field, so the agent never writes one.
    #   2. merge_utils.py:360 sets the merged file's `window` from
    #      `a.get("window")`, which is therefore None.
    #   3. `window.get("window", "unknown")` then returns None (not
    #      "unknown") because dict.get's default only kicks in when
    #      the key is MISSING — here the key exists with value None.
    #   4. `seq.setdefault("window", window_label)` was a no-op for any

    # Net effect across every match: 100% of sequences ended up tagged

    WHAT THIS FOUND, ON THE GORLESTON MATCH
    ---------------------------------------
    The schema asks for "timestamp": "[MMmSSs]" and never says which clock --
    absolute video time, time since kick-off, or an offset within the window.
    Each window's agent chose its own, and some chose none:

      * the window covering 10:00-15:00 returned fifteen observations
        stamped 00m00s, 01m00s, 02m00s ... 14m00s -- one per player, at
        exactly one-minute intervals. That is an index, not a reading.
      * the window covering 45:00-48:15 returned fifteen observations, all
        stamped 00m00s.
      * other windows returned irregular values (550s, 562s, 575s) that do
        look observed.

    Across 265 observations of a 121-minute match, not one timestamp exceeds
    25 minutes. They cannot be absolute. And frames[0] equals the timestamp
    in 264 of 265 cases -- the filename is generated from the number rather
    than the number being read off a frame.

    A timestamp outside its own window is not a reading whatever the agent
    intended by it, so it is removed rather than reinterpreted. Adding the
    window start would "fix" the honest offsets and silently legitimise the
    indices and the zeros, which look identical once shifted.

    SURVIVING THIS CHECK IS NOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH. On the Gorleston
    match it rejected 238 of 265, and 26 of the 27 survivors sit in the
    first four windows -- the only ones whose own range covers the low
    numbers the agent emits regardless of where it is looking. Sixteen
    consecutive windows from minute 20 onward kept nothing at all. The
    survivors passed by arithmetic coincidence, not because they were
    observed, so this check bounds the damage; it does not certify what is
    left.

    The frames on disk carry absolute time in their names
    (frame_00m00s.jpg ... frame_121m19s.jpg), so the fix upstream is to stop
    asking for a judgement that can be a copy: name the frame, and derive
    the time from the filename here.
