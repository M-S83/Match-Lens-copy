deep_skill_metrics.py -- Match Lens Step 3k

Translates aggregated findings into 20 performance-level tactical insights.

Metric set (20 total):
  System-level (5):     compactness, build_up_effectiveness, rest_defence_security,
                        pressing_intensity, line_height_range
  Behavioural (6):      width_usage, halfspace_occupation, transition_efficiency,
                        chance_creation_profile, pattern_reliability, build_up_route_diversity
  Tactical insight (4): predictability, pressing_trigger_consistency,
                        set_piece_delivery_profile, attacking_support_score
  Player (5):           role_consistency, positioning_stability, decision_profile,
                        movement_contribution, duel_effectiveness

REMOVED from previous version:
  shape_stability_score      -- always 1.0 for consistent teams, no signal
  spacing_control_score      -- proxy for line height already captured elsewhere
  weakside_utilisation_score -- requires weakside_visibility > 0.5, ball-tracking never achieves
  control_score              -- composite of composites, signal diluted twice
  dominance_score            -- meaningless without reliable shot data
  structural_integrity_score -- composite of composites, low value
  chaos_index                -- inverse of shape_stability, redundant
