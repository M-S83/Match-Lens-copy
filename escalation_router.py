"""
escalation_router.py -- Match Lens Step 3i escalation logic

Replaces the simple event-type whitelist with a rules-based router that:
  - reads all confirmation_queue entries from merged window JSONs
  - determines the correct escalation fps tier per result_family / evidence_tier
  - enforces the cap: 10 items max UNLESS there are more than 10 goals
    (if goals > 10, all goals are processed; other high-priority items fill remaining cap)
  - writes confirmation_queue.json

Cap rule:
  - If total goals ≤ 10: standard cap of 10 high-priority items applies
  - If total goals > 10: goals are uncapped; other high-priority items capped at
    max(0, 10 - len(non_goal_high)) to respect operator intent on unusual matches

Usage:
    python escalation_router.py [MATCH_DIR]

    Why: confirmation_queue.json items store match-clock timestamps

    display in reports and joining to merged-window set_piece records (which
    also use match-clock). But the burst frame extraction uses the timestamp
    as a video-clock offset, which is wrong when kickoff is not at video
    time 0 (typical: 30-90s of warmup before kickoff).

    This helper computes the video-clock equivalent. Queue items get an
    additional `anchor_video_s` field with the correct video seconds; the
    burst block reads that field for extract_segment instead of re-parsing
    the match-clock string.

    `half` is one of "1H" / "2H" / "ET1" / "ET2" (determined by
    _infer_half above).
