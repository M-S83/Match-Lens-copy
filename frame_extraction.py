"""
frame_extraction.py -- higher-fps frame extraction from source video

Used by Step 3d-SP (and future goal/event escalation) to extract a short
burst of frames at a target fps around an anchor timestamp. Distinct from
the 1fps extraction in Step 1, which extracts the whole match once.

Burst extractions go to a per-anchor temp folder so multiple bursts in the
same window do not collide. Frames are written at JPEG quality 90 (higher
than Step 1's 80) because spatial detail matters more at this stage --
runner positions, foot orientation, ball trajectory.

Usage:
    from frame_extraction import extract_segment

    frames = extract_segment(
        video_path     = r"[MATCH_DIR]/match.mp4",
        anchor_seconds = 1203.0,         # 20m03s
        out_dir        = r"[MATCH_DIR]/frames_burst/sp_20m03s",
        target_fps     = 5,
        padding_s      = 3,
    )
    # frames -> list of file paths, ordered chronologically

    Locate the source video file for higher-fps burst extraction.

    Resolution order (v3.0.1 bundle, Task 137 Approach B):
      1. match_config.json "video_path" field if present. Accepts an absolute
         path OR a path relative to match_dir. Path is verified to exist.
      2. Single .mp4 at the top level of match_dir (legacy behaviour).
      3. Multiple .mp4 in match_dir: pick the largest with a warning.

    Raises FileNotFoundError with an explicit operator-facing message when
    neither resolves -- the message names BOTH paths the operator could fix.

    Why this matters: operator-provided footage often lives in a working
    directory outside Match Lens Jobs/, and copying a 1-2 GB video into every
    match dir per run is wasteful + error-prone. The video_path field lets the
    operator point the pipeline at the original file without moving it.
