merge_utils.py -- Match Lens Step 3e

Merges agent window JSON outputs into a single merged file per window.
Event windows (dual agents): merge_dual_agents
Routine windows (single agent): merge_single_agent

Both functions apply re-run patches from rerun_queue.json before merging,
so the merged file always contains the best available frame data.

Usage:
    from merge_utils import merge_dual_agents, merge_single_agent, merge_all_windows

    # Merge a single dual-agent window:
    merge_dual_agents(a_path, b_path, out_path, agent_id, match_dir)

    # Merge a single routine window:
    merge_single_agent(a_path, out_path, agent_id, match_dir)

    # Merge all windows in the plan:
    merge_all_windows(match_dir)

        # the Task 144 note below, which patched gk_distribution and
        # far_side_shape individually). Enumerating cannot keep up with the
        # agent schema; spreading does.
