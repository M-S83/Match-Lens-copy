- Defensive block width: HIGHLY OBSERVABLE. Log whether block is
  narrow, standard, or wide on every window.
- Off-side line coordination: CLEARLY OBSERVABLE. The overhead
  angle is the optimal view for this — note any coordinated
  off-side traps.
- Jersey numbers: NOT LEGIBLE at this camera distance and height.
  Identify players by position, kit colour, movement pattern,
  and build only. Do not attempt to read shirt numbers. Use
  positional identifiers (home_CB_left, away_RB etc.) rather
  than names where uncertain.
- Scoreboard overlay: NOT PRESENT. Do not reference a clock
  or score from an overlay. Match state comes from match_config
  only.
- Shots under 1 second: Not observable at 1fps. Event agent
  at 5fps handles this for goal windows.
- Formation verification: HIGH CONFIDENCE from this source.
  The elevated overhead angle is the optimal view for shape reads.
  Both teams' full structures are visible simultaneously. You should
  be able to clearly identify the double pivot in a 4-2-3-1,
  the flat three in a 4-3-3, and the wing-back positioning in a
  three-at-the-back system. Override the lineup formation if the
  frames show a different shape consistently.

FORMATION_RECOGNITION_GUIDE = """
=== FORMATION RECOGNITION GUIDE ===

You have been given the lineup formations in match_config.
Treat these as hypotheses to verify, not as facts to repeat.

DISTINGUISHING CRITERIA (observable from elevated/wide camera):

4-4-2 FLAT:
  - Two banks of four at similar depth
  - No player clearly ahead of or behind the midfield line
  - Width from wide midfielders, not advanced forwards
  - Two strikers at similar depth

4-4-1-1:
  - Four defenders, four midfielders (same as 4-4-2)
  - ONE player clearly between the midfield and striker
  - ONE striker ahead of everyone
  - The #10 is visibly ahead of the midfield line but behind the striker

4-2-3-1:
  - TWO midfielders clearly deeper than the rest (double pivot)
  - THREE players between the pivot and the striker
  - The pivot pair sits noticeably behind the attacking three
  - ONE striker furthest forward
  KEY SIGNAL: visible gap between the two deep midfielders
  and the three ahead of them

4-3-3:
  - THREE midfielders at roughly similar depth (no clear pivot pair)
  - THREE forwards — two wide, one central
  - Wide forwards positioned high and wide
  - No player clearly between lines as a #10
  KEY SIGNAL: midfield line is flat (not split), forwards are wide

3-4-3 / 3-4-2-1:
  - THREE centre-backs visible — no fullbacks in the defensive line
  - TWO wing-backs very wide, higher than the CBs
  - Defensive line has three players, not two pairs

3-5-2:
  - THREE centre-backs
  - TWO wing-backs
  - THREE midfielders (single pivot or three flat)
  - TWO strikers

4-3-3 vs 4-2-3-1 quick test:
  Is there a visible gap between two deeper midfielders and
  three ahead of them? -> 4-2-3-1
  Is the midfield line flat with no obvious split? -> 4-3-3

4-4-2 vs 4-4-1-1 quick test:
  Are the two frontmost players at the same depth? -> 4-4-2
  Is one clearly ahead of the other with space between? -> 4-4-1-1

IF UNCERTAIN: State what you observe ("I see what appears to be
a double pivot with three ahead") and give your best formation
label with a confidence note. A qualified observation is more
valuable than a confident wrong answer.

IP/OOP OBSERVATION RULE:
The formation field records the PRIMARY shape (what the team
looks like in possession). The variation field records how the
shape changes out of possession.

Always observe both phases within a window if both are visible.
The most important IP/OOP variations to catch:

4-3-3 -> 4-5-1:  Wide forwards track back (most common)
4-2-3-1 -> 4-4-2: The #10 drops alongside the pivot
4-4-2 -> 4-4-2:  Shape consistent (many non-league teams)
3-4-3 -> 5-4-1:  Wing-backs drop into the back line
4-3-3 -> 4-3-3:  Shape consistent (high-press teams hold shape)

If only one phase is visible in this window, note which one
and set variation to "only [in/out of] possession phase observed".

FORMATION BASIS — set home_formation_basis and away_formation_basis:
  confirmed_from_frames  — you observed the shape clearly from frames
                           (whether it matches the lineup or not)
  overridden             — you observed a shape that clearly DIFFERS
                           from the lineup formation provided
  hypothesis_unverified  — frames don't give sufficient signal to
                           confirm or deny; you are defaulting to lineup

FORMATION EVIDENCE — set home_formation_evidence and away_formation_evidence:
A one-sentence citation of what was observable in the frames that
supports the formation label. REQUIRED for every output. The basis
field is a status flag; the evidence field is the proof.

For confirmed_from_frames and overridden: state which units you saw and
their relative position. Examples:
  "Back four visible with double pivot and three attackers ahead of the
   pivot; #10 drops between lines repeatedly."
  "Three centre-backs visible with wing-backs holding the touchline;
   two forwards rotate centrally."

For hypothesis_unverified: the value MUST be exactly:
  "No confirmatory structure visible; defaulting to lineup."

Do NOT echo the lineup formation label as evidence. "4-2-3-1 because
the lineup says so" is not evidence — it is the claim. The evidence
must describe what was visible in the frames independent of the label.
"""


SET_PIECE_GUIDE = """
=== SET PIECES ===
For every set piece (corner, free kick awarded in the attacking or middle third,
final-third throw-in, kickoff) log a set_piece entry.

TIMESTAMP is REQUIRED. Use the MMmSSs frame when the ball is struck or released
(frame of contact, not the foul or walk-up). If contact is obscured, use the
closest visible setup frame and set timestamp_inferred: true. NEVER omit timestamp
-- without it the downstream 5fps burst cannot run and the entry will be rejected.

TYPE values:
  corner_left / corner_right / direct_fk / indirect_fk /
  throw_final_third / kickoff

TEAM: home_kit or away_kit -- whichever team is taking the set piece.

TAKER: set taker_position to kit colour + shirt number if visible (e.g. "home_kit #7").
       Set null if you cannot clearly see who struck the ball. Do NOT guess.

READ AT 1fps (populate where visible):
  delivery_zone:  near_post / far_post / penalty_spot / edge_of_box / short
                  WHERE the ball was delivered to (from the frame after contact)
  bodies_in_box:  count of attacking-team players inside the 18-yard box,
                  from the frame just before delivery
  marking:        zonal / man / mixed / unclear
                  defensive setup from the frame before delivery
  rest_defence:   count of attacking-team players who stayed outside the 18-yard box
                  during their own delivery (transition cover indicator)
  outcome:        goal / cleared_near_post / cleared_far_post / gk_claim /
                  gk_punch / second_phase / lost_possession

For set_pieces and key_moments specifically: when in doubt, return null on the
unobservable field. Do NOT pick the first option in the enum list as a default.
Do NOT use the example schema values as defaults. The schema examples illustrate
field shape, not default values. The downstream pipeline tolerates null fields
cleanly; it does not tolerate fabricated content.

DELIVERY_OBSERVED: Set to false if you cannot see the delivery itself.
  Still log the entry with the setup frame timestamp -- the 5fps burst will
  recover delivery detail.

SETUP DETECTION -- log a set_piece entry whenever you observe ANY of:
  - A player standing over the ball at a corner flag
  - A defensive wall forming (3+ players aligned, facing the kicker)
  - The referee signalling a free kick in the attacking or middle third
  - Players gathering inside the 18-yard box without an active sequence in progress
  - A throw-in being taken from the final third

DO NOT attempt to populate at 1fps (leave as null -- filled by 5fps burst):
  delivery_type, runners, wall_size, wall_position

=== ANCHOR REQUIREMENT for set_piece and key_moment timestamps ===
Each set_piece and key_moment must be anchored to real frame(s) you
examined. Use ONE of two anchor types:

  delivery_frame: <single filename> -- when you saw the delivery (or
  key moment) in one specific frame and can identify it precisely.

  delivery_frame_range: ["<start>", "<end>"] -- when you saw activity
  consistent with the set_piece across multiple frames but cannot
  isolate the exact delivery moment. The range should span no more
  than 10 seconds (typically 5-8 seconds for a corner sequence).

Sub-second events (the moment of delivery, the moment of a card shown,
the moment of a goal) often span only 1-2 frames at 1fps sampling. If
you can see that something happened but cannot identify the exact frame,
use a range. The range is honest; null is honest; a fabricated single-
frame anchor is not.

If you can identify neither a single anchor frame nor a defensible
range: do NOT emit the entry. Inferring that "a corner probably happened
in this window" without visual evidence of it is fabrication.

For key_moments specifically: use observation_frame for moments you saw
directly (cards being shown, goal celebrations); use observation_frame_
range for moments you inferred from context across multiple frames
(tactical_shift, momentum_change).

The timestamp field MUST be derived from the anchor:
  - If you used delivery_frame="frame_25m11s.jpg", timestamp must be
    "25m11s" or within 1 second.
  - If you used delivery_frame_range=["frame_25m11s.jpg",
    "frame_25m17s.jpg"], timestamp must match the START of the range
    (here "25m11s") within 1 second.
Mismatched timestamp + frame anchor is a validation failure and the
entry will be dropped downstream.

The valid frame range for this window is shown in the prompt header
above (MATCH-CLOCK RANGE + VIDEO-FRAME RANGE). Cite real frames from
the frames you were actually shown in this input. Frames outside the
window's video-clock range are not valid anchors.

=== INCONCLUSIVE HANDLING for set_piece fields ===
The following rules apply field-by-field. Each is independent — leaving one
field null does NOT mean abandoning the whole entry.

  delivery_zone:  If you cannot directly observe where the ball was delivered
                  to (camera is on the taker / corner flag / pre-delivery
                  setup, not on the box at the moment of delivery), set
                  delivery_zone to null. Do NOT default to "near_post".

  bodies_in_box:  If you cannot count the bodies in the box at the delivery
                  moment (penalty area not in frame, or insufficient frames
                  spanning the delivery), set bodies_in_box to null. Do NOT
                  default to a guessed integer.

  marking:        If you cannot determine the marking system from the visible
                  defensive shape at delivery (zonal vs man vs mixed), set
                  marking to null. Do NOT default to "mixed".

  rest_defence:   If you cannot determine the rest-defence shape behind the
                  delivery zone, set rest_defence to null.

  outcome:        If the outcome of the delivery is not visible (you see the
                  run-up but not the resulting clearance / header / goal /
                  GK action), set outcome to null. Do NOT default to
                  "cleared_near_post".

The 5fps set_piece burst layer recovers what 1fps could not. Leaving fields
null at this stage is correct behaviour, not a failure. The downstream
aggregator tolerates null fields cleanly; it does not tolerate fabricated
content.

=== GK DISTRIBUTION -- LOG FOR BOTH TEAMS ===
Every GK kick (goal kick, from hands, back pass played out) -> add to gk_kicks[].
Log for BOTH teams.

=== PRESSING INTENSITY ===
The `pressing.home_intensity` and `pressing.away_intensity` fields are
0.0-10.0 floats. Each number MUST correspond to observable evidence in
the frames. Use these anchored tiers:

  0-2  — passive block. No outfield player engages the ball carrier
         above the team's own half. The team holds shape and waits.

  3-4  — mid-block with sporadic trigger. Typically one striker or
         lone #10 checks the ball-carrying CB on occasional cues;
         most attempts to receive are not pressured.

  5-6  — organised mid-press with a clear trigger. A defined press
         trigger fires (GK receives, CB receives turned, back pass)
         and at least two players step out in coordination. Press
         resets when the trigger ends.

  7-8  — sustained high press with multiple players engaging
         simultaneously. The front line and at least one midfielder
         press together for extended periods; defensive line steps
         up to support compactness.

  9-10 — immediate ball-win attempt at every restart. Press starts
         before the GK can distribute; multiple players close
         passing lanes simultaneously; the team commits numbers
         beyond the ball with the intent to win possession high.

Do NOT use intensity as a vague descriptor. A number without a tier-
matching observable pattern is not grounded — pick the tier whose
description matches what you can see, then return the midpoint of
that tier (e.g. 3.5 for mid-block, 5.5 for organised mid-press).

If pressing behaviour is not observable in this window (ball
follow-cam stays on the ball carrier, defensive shape never visible),
return null for the relevant intensity field — not 0.0. Zero is the
floor for "the team chose not to press"; null is the floor for "I
could not see whether they pressed."

=== PRESSING TRIGGER VOCABULARY ===
The `pressing.home_trigger` and `pressing.away_trigger` fields MUST
use one of these canonical codes (or null). Free-text triggers cannot
aggregate across windows; the codes can.

  back_pass               — opposition plays a backward pass; press
                            fires on the receiving defender
  gk_in_possession        — goalkeeper receives or holds the ball;
                            press fires on the GK directly
  cb_receiving_turned     — centre-back receives with their back to
                            their own goal; press fires on the
                            attempted turn
  cb_receiving_open       — centre-back receives facing forward; press
                            fires on the next decision (pass forward
                            or carry)
  fb_receiving            — full-back receives the ball; press fires
                            on the touchline trap
  free_kick_restart       — opposition restarts from a free kick in
                            their defensive third; press fires on the
                            short option
  throw_in_restart        — opposition takes a throw-in in their
                            defensive or middle third; press fires on
                            the receiver
  no_trigger_observed     — pressing intensity was non-zero but no
                            specific trigger pattern was identifiable
  null                    — no pressing observed, or pressing
                            behaviour not observable in this window
                            (matches null intensity)

Pick the single trigger that fires MOST OFTEN in this window. If two
triggers fire roughly equally, pick the one that produced the higher
press intensity. Do NOT invent triggers ("press_on_central_play",
"press_on_long_ball") — if the pattern you saw doesn't fit one of
the codes above, use no_trigger_observed and describe what you saw in
the window's notes field.

=== BOTH TEAMS SEQUENCES ===
Log EVERY distinct possession sequence in the window, for BOTH teams.
Tag each: "team": "home_kit" or "team": "away_kit"

SCALE ANCHOR (read this before logging anything): a five-minute
window of open play produces 15-30 distinct possession sequences
when home and away are combined. That is roughly 3-6 sequences per
minute of play. The default failure mode of 1fps tactical analysis
is to log a small number of high-confidence sequences and miss the
small, unremarkable recycling sequences that make up the bulk of
any match. Open-play sequences that did not progress are still
sequences. Goal kicks distributed short are still sequences. A
throw-in followed by two passes back to a CB is still a sequence.

Before finalising your output, COUNT your pass_sequences array:
  - 15-30 total: normal range, ship it
  - 10-14: borderline — was there an unusual stoppage in this window?
           if not, you're missing routine sequences; review again
  - <10:   you have missed sequences. This is a known failure mode of
           1fps tactical analysis on conservative-trained models. Scan
           the frames a second time looking specifically for: short
           throw-in restarts, goal kicks distributed short, midfield
           recycling between CBs and the DM, and back-passes from
           wide players to inside midfielders. These routine sequences
           do not feel notable but they are sequences and must be logged.
           Also: one-touch passes that lose possession ("attempted pass
           under pressure, intercepted") still count as sequences. The
           chain is short ([#N] ->F [#N opposition recovery]) but the
           possession attempt happened and should be logged.

Windows with long stoppages (lengthy injuries, VAR checks, multiple
substitutions) legitimately produce fewer sequences — use honest
judgement, not quota-hitting.

A possession sequence is any chain of TWO OR MORE consecutive passes
by the same team (or one pass that leads directly to a shot, cross,
or set piece). A sequence STARTS at:
  - possession gain (interception, tackle win, loose ball recovery)
  - restart (throw-in, free kick, corner, goal kick)
  - GK distribution
And ENDS at:
  - turnover (opposition wins ball)
  - shot
  - cross into the box
  - clearance under pressure
  - set piece concession (foul, ball out)
  - end_of_window (sequence still in progress at the final frame)

Log each sequence as a chain of touches in the chain_notation field:
  [#N] ->F [#N] ->S [#N] ->[outcome]
Direction codes: F=forward  S=sideways  B=backward
Outcome vocabulary: shot / cross / lost_possession / clearance /
                    set_piece / end_of_window

Touch tokens may be either jersey number [#N] or position label [POS]:
  Use [#N] when the jersey number is clearly readable
  Use [POS] when the number is not legible but the player's role is
  clear from positioning. Valid POS codes: GK, RB, RCB, LCB, LB,
  RWB, LWB, DM, CM, RCM, LCM, AM, RW, LW, RM, LM, CF, ST
  Mixing within a single chain is fine:
    [#10] ->F [LCB] ->S [#7] ->shot

Every sequence MUST carry a `sequence_confidence` field tagged against
what was observable in the frames:

  high   — the ball is visible at or in immediate contact with the
           start player AND with the end player. Both endpoints
           confirmed by direct ball observation.

  medium — the ball is visible at one endpoint (start OR end) but not
           the other. Intermediate touches inferred from player
           orientation, movement direction, and clustering.

  low    — the ball is not visible at either endpoint, but you can
           still identify the start and end players from positional
           context. The chain itself is inferred. This is the most
           under-logged category historically: when you are tempted to
           skip a sequence because you "didn't quite see it clearly,"
           log it at low instead.

`low` is acceptable and expected on ball-following footage where the
ball is occluded in 20-40% of build-up frames. Log the sequence at
`low` rather than skipping it. Downstream coverage analysis weights
low-confidence sequences correctly; skipping them silently undercounts
the match.

ONLY skip a sequence entirely when you cannot identify EITHER endpoint
player. That is the floor: "I cannot tell who had the ball" — not "I
cannot see the ball."

name from the roster below. Format: "First Last (#number)" — e.g.
"Charlie Stallard (#11)" not "Wingate striker #11", not
"Cray Wanderers #9", not "home_ST".

If the jersey number is not legible, infer the most likely player from
position, kit, and movement and write that exact roster name. Only fall
back to a positional identifier ("home_CB_left", "away_RB") if the
player is genuinely unidentifiable from any of: kit, position, build,
or relative location to teammates.

HOME TEAM — {_home_p}:
{chr(10).join(home_lineup_lines)}

AWAY TEAM — {_away_p}:
{chr(10).join(away_lineup_lines)}

=== ACTION VOCABULARY ===
When you populate the `action` field of an individual_observation,
use one of these canonical terms wherever it fits. The accumulator
uses these tokens to detect run-type and movement patterns across
the match. Free-text descriptions still go in `observation`.

MOVEMENT PATTERNS (pick the closest one for `action`):
  "run in behind"     — runs beyond the last defender into space
  "drop deep"         — drops into midfield or defensive third to receive
  "overlap"           — overlapping run beyond a wide teammate
  "underlap"          — inside run beyond a wide teammate, into the halfspace
  "channel run"       — diagonal run into the channel between CB and FB
  "late run into box" — arrives in the penalty area from deep
  "hold up play"      — receives with back to goal, holds and lays off
  "run at defender"   — carries the ball directly at an opponent

DEFENSIVE PATTERNS:
  "press"             — closes down the ball carrier
  "track back"        — defensive recovery run
  "screen"            — positions to block central passing lanes
  "aerial duel"       — challenges for a headed ball

If the action does not fit a canonical term, use a brief
descriptive phrase (e.g. "switches play", "crosses from wide").
But prefer the canonical terms above whenever they apply —
they enable pattern aggregation across the whole match.

Output JSON ONLY. No prose. No preamble. No markdown fences.

=== MATCH CONTEXT ===
HOME: {home_team} (kit: {kits.get("home", "unknown")})
AWAY: {away_team} (kit: {kits.get("away", "unknown")})
{kit_block}
=== SOURCE CONTEXT ===
{source_block}

Timestamp:      {anchor_ts}
Type:           {sp_type}
Team:           {team} ({team_name})
Taker position: {taker_pos if taker_pos else "null (not observed at 1fps)"}

=== TASK ===
FIRST, verify the claimed event exists.

Do these {target_fps}fps frames actually show a {sp_type} at {anchor_ts}
taken by the {team}?

If NO -- the frames show open play, kickoff, halftime, stoppage, a
different event, or the camera is on a different part of the pitch:

  Set status to "inconclusive".
  Populate rejection_reason with what you actually see in the frames
  (e.g. "Camera on centre circle for kickoff; no corner taken at this
  timestamp", or "Frames show players returning from celebration after a
  goal in the previous minute; no set piece occurring").
  STOP. Do NOT confirm fields. Do NOT fabricate runners. Do NOT write a
  burst_notes narrative.

If YES -- the {sp_type} is visible -- set status to "confirmed" and
continue.

=== 1FPS OBSERVATIONS TO CONFIRM (only if status="confirmed") ===
The 1fps pass recorded the following. Confirm each field or correct based on
what the {target_fps}fps frames show. For any field you correct, log the prior
value and a brief reason in the corrections array.

bodies_in_box:   {bodies_1fps}
delivery_zone:   {delivery_zone_1fps}
marking_system:  {marking_1fps}
outcome:         {outcome_1fps}

=== BURST-ONLY FIELDS ===
Fill these fields. 1fps could not read them.

delivery_type:        inswinger / outswinger / driven / lofted / flick_on / short_routine / null
                      (null only if delivery itself was not visible)
delivery_target_zone: near_post / penalty_spot / far_post / edge_of_box / short_corner / null
                      (where the delivery was AIMED -- may differ from where it ENDED UP)
runners:              For each attacking-team runner visible in the burst, log:
                        runner_id          -- shirt number (e.g. "#7") if visible. If the number
                                              is not clearly visible, use a kit + position label
                                              (e.g. "red CB", "blue near_post_runner"). NEVER use

                                              NEVER a name. Or null if unmarked.

                      Type-specific runner-count anchors:
                        corner:               3-5 visible runners is typical (front post,
                                              back post, penalty spot, edge of box,
                                              possible second-phase runner outside)
                        direct_fk (shooting): runner count inside the box is typically 2-4;
                                              also note wall_size and wall_position
                        indirect_fk:          3-5 visible runners (same as corner)
                        throw_in (final third): 2-3 visible runners is typical (one short
                                              receiver, one or two box arrivals)
                      Do not invent runners. If only one runner is clearly visible, log one.
wall_size:            number, for direct free kicks within shooting range only. null otherwise
wall_position:        near_post / central / far_post / null
second_phase:         object with:
                        winner           -- home_kit / away_kit / contested / null

=== ANCHORING RULE ===
This burst is anchored to ONE set piece at {anchor_ts}. Frames may show events
before or after (lead-up, second phase, a recycled corner). Focus output on the
set piece at {anchor_ts}. Related events go in second_phase, NOT as new records.
The pipeline has already queued separate bursts for separate events if needed.

=== ANTI-GUESS RULE ===
The downstream pipeline tolerates "inconclusive" cleanly. It does NOT tolerate
fabricated content.

If you find yourself inventing runners or authoring a burst_notes narrative
without direct visual evidence in the burst frames, STOP and set status to
"inconclusive". An inconclusive verdict surfaces an upstream 1fps fabrication;
a fabricated confirmation buries it.

The 1fps pass can produce false positives -- it samples one frame per second
and sometimes interprets ambiguous goalmouth pressure as a set piece that did
not happen. Your 5fps burst exists precisely to catch those. Reject them
honestly. The pipeline depends on it.
