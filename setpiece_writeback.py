setpiece_writeback.py -- Step 3d-SP-WB

Merges 5fps burst outputs (from the set piece agent) back into the
matching set_piece records in the merged window file and running_summary.json.

Called after all set piece bursts have completed (Step 3d-SP).

Usage:

    # Process all burst files in one pass:
    writeback_all_bursts(match_dir)

    # Or process a single burst:
    writeback_burst(burst_path, merged_window_path, summary_path)
