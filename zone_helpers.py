Programmatic helpers for the v2 zone system.

Public functions:

    resolve_named_zone(zone_obj) -> str | None
    normalise_zone(zone_obj) -> dict
    validate_between_lines(zone_obj, source_profile) -> dict

      "named_zone":     str | None,
      "between_lines":  str | None
    }

This module is deterministic. It runs after agent JSON is parsed, before the
data feeds into running_summary and deep_skill_metrics. It does NOT call LLMs
or extract frames -- it just normalises and derives.

Run order in the pipeline:
    Step 3a writes agent_NN_*.json    ->  agent zone fields filled
    Step 3b writes _player.json       ->  agent zone fields filled
    Step 3e merges into _merged.json  ->  call walk_findings_apply_zone_helpers
    Step 3f appends to pass_sequences ->  vertical_progression already on each
